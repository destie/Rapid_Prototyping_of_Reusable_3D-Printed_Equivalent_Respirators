# Rapid_Prototyping_of_Reusable_3D-Printed_Equivalent_Respirators
This respository contains code and information pertaining to our project to develop 3D printed N95 equivalent respirators for use in healthcare shortage settings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study was conducted at the beginning of the USA 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in March of 2020 to evaluate 3D printed N95 equivalent respirator options for use in healthcare shortage situations. 

Our group selected a series of mask designs from publically available templates, tested out a variety of materials to see which would work best and be safest for practitioners in a healthcare setting, compared these to standard facial measures and testing measures to ensure proper sizing and sealant for fit, and then created prototypes to be used at local hospitals. This effort was a collaboration between biomedical engineering, critical care, radiation oncology, and infectious disease departments at the George Washington University and lead to the production of a couple hundred 3D-printed respirators for emergency use if needed at the hospital.

Abstract:
The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused an acute reduction in world supplies of personal protective
equipment (PPE) due to increased demand. To combat the impending shortage of equipment including N95 masks,
the George Washington University Hospital (GWUH) developed a 3D printed reusable N95 comparable respirator
that can be used with multiple filtration units. We evaluated several candidate prototype respirator models, 3D print-
er filaments, and filtration units detailed here. Our most recent working model was based on a respirator found on an
open source maker website and was developed with PLA (printer filament), a removable cap, a removable filtration
unit consisting of two layers of MERV 16 sandwiched between MERV 13, and removable elastic bands to secure the
mask. Our candidate mask passed our own suction test protocol to evaluate leakage and passed a qualitative Bitrix
N95 fit test at employee health at GWUH. Further efforts are directed at improving the current model for seal
against face, comfort, and sizing. The 3D model is available upon request and in the supplement of this paper. We
welcome collaboration with other institutions and suggest other facilities consider mask fit for their own population
when exploring this concept.
